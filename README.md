# Markowitz-Portfolio-Optimization
Markowitz's mean-variance optimization to construct the efficient frontier using Python


1. Choose any 10 risky assets from the market. These could be stocks, bonds, ETFs, or any
other investable assets with readily available price data.
2. Gather the closing prices for your chosen assets over the past 3 months.

3. Calculate the simple/log returns for each asset over the chosen period.
4. Apply Markowitz's mean-variance optimization to construct the efficient frontier.
5. Choose two points on the efficient frontier representing two different risk tolerance levels.
For each point, calculate the corresponding weights for each asset to construct a portfolio that
maximizes expected return for that given level of risk.


Submission guidelines:
You can complete the task using Excel, Python or R. Anyone of the group members can
submit the deliverables on behalf of the group.
The report should include:
1. A brief description of your chosen assets
2. The calculated returns and risk measures for each asset.
3. A graph showing the Markowitz efficient frontier and the two chosen points.
4. The optimal portfolio weights for each chosen point on the efficient frontier.
5. A brief discussion of the trade-off between risk and return in your portfolio choices.
6. Discussion of the limitations of Markowitz optimization and its real-world applications.

The submission should include:
1. ppt
2. Data Used by your group
3. The .Py or .R file if you have done the analysis using python or R respectively. If you have
done the analysis using excel then share the excel sheet.
